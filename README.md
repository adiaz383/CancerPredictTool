# Uterine Cancer Recurrence Study

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to study how different variables affect recurrence and the time to recurrence in patients diagnosed with uterine cancer. This research utilizes data from the TCGA corpus and focuses on five key areas:

Clinical Information: Demographic and clinical details about the patient.

Sample Information: Data on the samples taken from the patients.

Sample Acquisition Information: Details regarding the acquisition of the samples.

Status Changes: Records of changes in the patient's status during different clinical visits.

Treatment Information: Information about the treatments received by the patients.

## Data Description
We have compiled and cleaned data for a total of 529 patients (ucec_patients_data). The dataset has been organized and concatenated into a single file for easier processing. The file is color-coded into five different sections corresponding to the areas mentioned above.

Once downloaded, the data file will be ready for analysis. The color-coding helps to quickly identify and differentiate between the different types of information.
